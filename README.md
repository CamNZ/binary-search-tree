# Binary Search Tree .so

A C++ dynamic library that implements a binary search tree data structure. Created for educational purposes.

## Getting  Started

### Prerequisites
```
Ubuntu >= 16.04
Python ctypes
```

Has not been tested on other operating systems, but should be easy to compile with minor changes to build process.

### Installing

```
git clone
make all
make test
```

### Usage

Can be linked to from any language that supports calls to a C interface (Python, Matlab, C#, etc). See interface.hpp for full public interface. See example.py for an example of linking from python using the ctypes module.

### Max node limit

By default the maximum node limit is set to 20,000. This is to prevent stack overflow from a large number of stack frames being generated by recursive calls. Even though binary search trees are famed for their O(log n) operations, this only holds true if the tree is balanced. If the tree is imbalanced the worst case is O(n).

### Feedback

Any constructive feedback on how this could be improved is welcome
